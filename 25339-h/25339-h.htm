<p>Through the past year, M. de Lamartine has
published a monthly journal, called The People&rsquo;s
Counsellor, &ldquo;<i>Le Conseiller du Peuple</i>.&rdquo; Each
number of this journal contains an Essay, by him,
on some specific subject, of pressing interest to
the French people,&mdash;generally, some political
subject.</p>

<p>As a companion to one of these numbers, he
published the Essay which we here translate.
We have thought that its interest and merit are
by no means local; but, that it will be read with
as much interest in America, as in France.</p>

<h1 style="padding-top: 3em;">ATHEISM AMONG THE PEOPLE.</h1>



<h2 style="padding-top: 3em;">I.</h2>


<p>I have often asked myself, &ldquo;Why
am I a Republican?&mdash;Why am I the
partizan of equitable Democracy, organized
and established as a good and
strong Government?&mdash;Why have I a
real love of the People&mdash;a love always
serious, and sometimes even tender?&mdash;What
has the People done for me? I
was not born in the ranks of the People.
I was born between the high
Aristocracy and what was then called
<em>the inferior classes</em>, in the days when
there were classes, where are now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
equal citizens in various callings. I
never starved in the People&rsquo;s famine;
I never groaned, personally, in the
People&rsquo;s miseries; I never sweat with
its sweat; I was never benumbed with
its cold. Why then, I repeat it, do I
hunger in its hunger, thirst with its
thirst, warm under its sun, freeze under
its cold, grieve under its sorrows?
Why should I not care for it as little
as for that which passes at the antipodes?&mdash;turn
away my eyes, close my
ears, think of other things, and wrap
myself up in that soft, thick garment of
indifference and egotism, in which I can
shelter myself, and indulge my separate
personal tastes, without asking whether,
below me,&mdash;in street, garret, or cottage,
there is a rich People, or a beggar People;
a religious People, or an atheistic
People; a People of idlers, or of workers;
a People of Helots, or of citizens?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
And whenever I have thus questioned
myself, I have thus answered myself:&mdash;&ldquo;I
love the people because I believe in
God. For, if I did not believe in God,
what would the people be to me? I
should enjoy at ease that lucky throw
of the dice, which chance had turned
up for me, the day of my birth; and,
with a secret, savage joy, I should say,
&lsquo;So much the worse for the losers!&mdash;the
world is a lottery. Woe to the
conquered!&rsquo;&rdquo; I cannot, indeed, say
this without shame and cruelty,&mdash;for,
I repeat it, <em>I believe in God</em>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>II.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;And what is there in common,&rdquo; you
will say to me, &ldquo;between your belief in
God and your love for the People?&rdquo; I
answer: My belief in God is not that
vague, confused, indefinite, shadowy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
sentiment which compels one to suppose
a principle because he sees consequences,&mdash;a
cause where he contemplates
effects, a source where he sees
the rush of the inexhaustible river of
life, of forms, of substances, absorbed
for ever in the ocean, and renewed unceasingly
from creation. The belief in
God, which is thus perceived and conceived,
is, so to speak, only a mechanical
sensation of the interior eye,&mdash;an
instinct of intelligence, in some sort
forced and brutal,&mdash;an evidence, not
reasonable, not religious, not perfect,
not meritorious; but like the material
evidence of light, which enters our eyes
when we open them to the day; like
the evidence of sound which we hear
when we listen to any noise; like the
evidence of touch when we plunge our
limbs in the waves of the sea, and
shiver at the contact. This elementary,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
gross, instinctive, involuntary belief in
God, is not the living, intelligent, active,
and legislative faith of humanity. It is
almost animal. I am persuaded that if
the brutes even,&mdash;if the dog, the horse,
the ox, the elephant, the bird, could
speak, they would confess, that, at the
bottom of their nature, their instincts,
their sensations, their obtuse intelligence,
assisted by organs less perfect
than ours, there is a clouded, secret sentiment
of this existence of a superior
and primordial Being, from whom all
emanates, and to whom all returns,&mdash;a
shadow of the divinity upon their
being, a distant approach to the conception
of that idea, which fills the
worlds, and for which alone the worlds
have been made,&mdash;the idea of God!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>This may be a bold, but it is not an
impious supposition. For God, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
made all things for himself alone, must
have placed, upon all that he made, an
impress of himself; more or less clear,
more or less luminous, more or less
profound, a presentiment or a remembrance
of a Creator. But this faith,
when it stops here, is not worthy of the
name. It is a species of <em>Pantheism</em>,
that is to say, a confused &ldquo;visibility,&rdquo; a
physical working together into indissoluble
union of something impersonal,
something blind, something fatal, and
something divine, which, in the elements
composing the universe, we may
call <span class="smcap">God</span>. But this &ldquo;visibility&rdquo; can
give to man no moral decision,&mdash;can
give to God no worship. The Pantheism
of which I am accused as a philosopher
and poet, that Pantheism which
I have always scorned as a contradiction
and as a blasphemy, resembles
entirely the reasoning of the man who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
should say, &ldquo;I see an innumerable
multitude of rays, therefore there is no
sun.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>III.</h2>


<p>Faith, or reasonable and effective
belief in God, proceeds, undoubtedly,
from this first instinct; but in proportion
as intelligence develops itself, and
human thought expands, it goes from
knowledge to knowledge, from conclusion
to conclusion, from light to light,
from sentiment to sentiment, infinitely
farther and higher, in the idea of God.
It does not see him with the eyes of
the body, because the Infinite is not
visible by a narrow window of flesh,
pierced in the frontal bone of an insect
called Man; but it sees Him, with a
thousand times more certainty, by the
spirit, that immaterial eye of the soul,
which nothing blinds; and after having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
seen him with evidence, it reasons upon
the consequences of his existence, upon
the divine aims of His creation, upon
the terrestrial as well as eternal destinies
of His creatures, upon the nature
of the homage and adoration that God
expects, upon his moral laws, upon the
public and private duties which he
imposes on his creatures by their consciences,
upon the liberty He leaves
them; so that with the sufferings of
conflict He may give to them the merits
and the prize of virtue. Thus in
man does the instinct of God become
Faith. Thus man can speak the greatest
word that has ever been spoken
upon the earth or in the stars, the word
which fills the worlds by itself alone,
the word which commenced with them,
and which can only end with them;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe in God!&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span></p>

<h2>IV.</h2>


<p>It is in this sense, my friends, that I
say to you, &ldquo;I believe in God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, once having said this word with
the universe of beings and of worlds,
and blessed this invisible God for having
rendered himself visible, sensible,
evident, palpable, adorable in the mirror
of weak human intelligence, made gradually
more and more pure, I reason
with myself on the best worship to be
rendered Him in thought and action.
Let me show how, by this reasoning, I
am forcibly drawn to the love of the
People.</p>

<p>I say to myself, then, &ldquo;Who is this
God? Is he a vain <em>notion</em>, which has
no effect on the thoughts and acts of
man, his creature; who inspires nothing
in him; who gives him no commands;
who imposes nothing upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
him; who does not reward, and who
does not punish?&mdash;No! God is not a
mere <em>notion</em>, an idea, an evidence;&mdash;God
is a <em>law</em>,&mdash;the living law, the supreme
law, the universal law, the eternal
law. Because God is a law on
high, he is a duty on the earth; and
when man says, &lsquo;I believe in God,&rsquo; he
says, at the same time, &lsquo;I believe in my
duty towards God,&mdash;I believe in my
duty towards man.&rsquo; God is a government!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And what are these duties? They
are of three sorts:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Duty towards God</em>,&mdash;that is to say,
the duty of developing, as much as
possible, my intelligence and my reason,
to arrive at the purest idea and the
highest worship of the Supreme Being,
by whom and for whom all is, all exists:&mdash;<em>Religion</em>.</p>

<p><em>Private Duties</em>,&mdash;that is to say, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
exact and tender discharge of all sentiments
to which form has been given,
either in written or unwritten laws,
which bind me to those, to whom, in
the order of nature, I hold most closely,&mdash;the
nearest to myself in the human
group&mdash;father, mother, brothers, sisters,
wife, children, friends, neighbors:&mdash;<em>the
Family</em>.</p>

<p><em>Collective Duties</em>,&mdash;that is to say, devotions,
even to the sacrifice of myself,
even to death, to the progress, the well-being,
the preservation, the amelioration
of this great human family, of which
my family, and my country, are only
parts; and of which I myself am only
a miserable and vanishing fraction, a
leaf of a summer, which vegetates
and withers on a branch of the immense
trunk of the human race:&mdash;<em>Society</em>.</p>

<p>Let us speak to-day only of these last
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
duties,&mdash;because, now we are occupied
with politics alone.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>V.</h2>


<p>God, when one believes in Him as
you and I do, imposes then on man a
duty towards the society of which he
makes a part. You admit it, do you not?</p>

<p>Then follow, and analyze with me
this society. Of whom, and how, is it
composed?</p>

<p>It is composed, at the same time, of
strong and weak, conquerors and conquered,
victors and vanquished, oppressors
and oppressed, masters and slaves,
nobles and serfs, of citizens and bondmen
or subjects disinherited and enslaved,
considered as living furniture,
as tools and laughing-stocks to their
fellow-men, as were the Blacks in our
colonies before the Republic.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
Thanks to the increase of general
reason, to the light of philosophy, to
the inspiration of Christianity, to the
progress of the idea of justice, of charity,
and of fraternity, in laws, manners,
and religion, society in America, in
Europe, and in France, especially since
the Revolution, has broken down all
these barriers, all these denominations
of caste, all these injurious distinctions
among men. Society is composed only
of various conditions, professions, functions,
and ways of life, among those
who form what we call a Nation; of
proprietors of the soil, and proprietors
of houses; of investments, of handicrafts,
of merchants, of manufacturers,
of farmers; of day-laborers becoming
farmers, manufacturers, merchants, or
possessors of houses or capital, in their
turn; of the rich, of those in easy circumstances,
of the poor, of workmen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
with their hands, workmen with their
minds; of day-laborers, of those in
need, of a small number of men enjoying
considerable acquired or inherited
wealth, of others of a smaller fortune
painfully increased and improved, of
others with property only sufficient for
their needs; there are some, finally,
without any personal possession but
their hands, and gleaning for themselves
and for their families, in the
workshop, or the field, and at the
threshold of the homes of others on
the earth, the asylum, the wages, the
bread, the instruction, the tools, the
daily pay, all those means of existence
which they have neither inherited,
saved, nor acquired. These last are
what have been improperly called <em>the
People</em>. This name is extended now;
it embraces really all the People; but
still it is used as the name of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
indigent and suffering part of the People.</p>

<p>It is more especially of this class that
I intend to speak, in saying to you, &ldquo;To
love the People, it is necessary to believe
in God.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>VI.</h2>


<p>The love of the People, the conscience
of the citizen, the sentiment
which induces the individual to lose
himself in the mass, to submit himself
to the community, to sacrifice himself
to its needs,&mdash;his interest, his individuality,
his egotism, his ambition, his
pride, his fortune, his blood, his life, his
reputation even, sometimes, to the safety
of his country, to the happiness of the
People, to the good of humanity, of
which he is a member in the sight of
God,&mdash;in one word, all these virtues,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
necessary under every form of government,&mdash;useful
under a monarchy, indispensable
under a republic,&mdash;never
have been derived, and never can be
derived, from any thing but that single
sentence, pronounced with religious
faith, at the commencement, in the
middle, at the end of all our patriotic
acts:&mdash;&ldquo;I believe in God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The People who do not believe
strongly, efficaciously in this first principle,
in this supreme original, in this
last end of all existence, cannot have
a faith superior to their individual selfishness.</p>

<p>The People who cannot have a
principle superior to their individual
selfishness, in their acts as citizens,
cannot have national virtue.</p>

<p>The People who cannot have national
virtue cannot be free; for they
can have neither the courage which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
enables them to defend their own liberty,
nor the conscience which forces
them to respect the liberty of others,
and to obey the laws, not as an outward
force, but as a second conscience.</p>

<p>The People who can neither defend
their liberty, nor restrain it, may be, by
turns, slaves or tyrants, but they can
never be republicans.</p>

<p>Therefore, Atheism in the People is
the most invincible obstacle to the
establishment and consolidation of that
sublime form of government, the idol
of all ages, the tendency of all perfect
civilization, the dream of every sage,
the model of all great souls,&mdash;the government
of the entire People by the
reason and conscience of each citizen,&mdash;otherwise
called the <span class="smcap">Republic</span>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span></p>

<h2>VII.</h2>


<p>Must I demonstrate to you so simple
a truth? Can you not comprehend,
without explanation of mine, that a
nation, where each citizen thinks only
of his own private well-being here below,
and sacrifices constantly the general
good to his personal and narrow
interest;&mdash;where the powerful man
wishes to preserve all the power for
himself alone, without making an equitable
and proportional division to the
weak;&mdash;where the weak wishes to
conquer at any price, that he may
tyrannize in his turn;&mdash;where the
rich wishes to acquire and concentrate
the greatest possible amount of wealth,
to enjoy it alone, and even without circulating
it in work, in wages, in assistance,
in benevolence, in good deeds to
his brothers;&mdash;where the poor wishes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
to dispossess violently and unjustly
those who possess more than himself,
instead of recognizing that diversity
of chances, of conditions, of professions,
of fortunes, of which human
life is composed,&mdash;instead of acquiring
prosperity for his family, in his turn
and degree, by effort, by order, by
labor, by economy, by the assistance
of borrowed capital, by the law of inheritance,
by the free transfer of real
estate, by free entrance into different
callings and trades, by free competition
in the money market;&mdash;where each
class of citizens declares itself an enemy
to every other, and heaps upon each
other all manner of evil, instead of
doing all the good in its power, and
uniting in the holy harmony of social
unity;&mdash;where each individual draws
around him, for himself alone, the
common mantle, willing to tear it in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
pieces for himself, and thus leave the
whole world naked,&mdash;do you not understand,
I say, that such a People,
having no God but its selfishness, no
judge but interest, no conscience but
cupidity, will fall, in a short time, into
complete destruction, and, being incapable
of a Republican government, because
it casts aside the government of God
himself, will rush headlong into the
government of the brute: the government
of the strongest, the despotism
of the sword, the divinity of the cannon,&mdash;that
last resort of anarchy,
which is at once the remedy and the
death of nations without God!</p>

<p>Now has not this weakening of the
sentiment of God in the soul of the
People been, from year to year, from
century to century, indeed, I might say,
the most discouraging and threatening
symptom, in the eyes of those who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
desire the progress of their race, who
aspire to the moral perfection of the
human spirit, who hope in Republican
institutions, who love the People, who
wish to cultivate their reason, who desire
that the People should understand
themselves, respect themselves, and,
finally, by their enlightenment, their
conscientiousness, their moderation and
virtue, give the lie to those who declare
them in a state of perpetual infancy,
perpetual madness, or perpetual weakness?</p>

<p>Yes, this is but too true: men have
been blotting out God, for a century
past, from the souls of the People, and
more especially in latter years. The
masses have been driven to Atheism,
they have been driven on every side
and by every hand.</p>

<p>Sometimes, by blasphemies, such as
were never heard upon the earth, until
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
an insult to the Creator became a
means of popularity among His creatures;
blasphemies which would have
darkened the sun and extinguished the
stars, if God had not commanded His
creation to pass unnoticed the revolt
of a blind and foolish insect against
Infinity, and refused Himself to sink to
the foolishness of avenging impiety!
Read those lines which I dare not
write, those lines where an apostle of
Atheism effaces the name of God from
the beautiful creation and endeavors to
substitute his own! * * *</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>VIII.</h2>


<p>Sometimes the masses have been
driven to Atheism by science. There
are some geometers great in paradox,
men who, of all the senses that the
Creator has given to his creatures, have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
cultivated only one, the sense of touch,&mdash;leaving
out entirely that chief sense,
which connects and confirms all others,&mdash;<em>the
sense of the invisible</em>, the <em>moral
sense</em>. These <em>savans</em>, geometers, physicians,
arithmeticians, mathematicians,
chemists, astronomers, measurers of
distances, calculators of numbers, have
early acquired the habit of believing
only in the <em>tangible</em>. These are the
beings who, so to speak, live and think
in the dark; all, which is not palpable,
does not exist for them. They measure
the earth, and say, &ldquo;We have not met
God in any league of its surface!&rdquo;
They heat the alembic, and say, &ldquo;We
have not perceived God in the smoke
of any of our experiments!&rdquo; They
dissect dead bodies, and say, &ldquo;We have
not found God, or thought, in any bundle
of muscles or nerves in our dissection!&rdquo;
They calculate columns of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
figures, long as the firmament, and say,
&ldquo;We have not seen God in the sum of
any of our additions!&rdquo; They pierce,
with eye and glass, into the dazzling
mysteries of night, to discover, across
thousands and thousands of leagues,
the groups and the evolutions of the
celestial worlds, and say, &ldquo;We have not
discovered God at the end of our telescopes!
The existence of God does not
concern us; it is no affair of ours!&rdquo;&mdash;Madmen!
They do not suspect that
the knowledge and adoration of God
are, at bottom, the only business of the
creature; and that all these distances,
these globes, these numbers, these mysteries
of the living being, this dissected
mechanism of the dead, these compositions
and decompositions of combined
elements, these hosts of stars, and these
eternal evolutions of suns around the
divine hand which guides them, have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
no other reason for existence, for movement,
and for duration, than to compel
the acknowledgment, fear, admiration,
and adoration of God, by that supreme
sense, that sense superior to all other
senses, that sense imponderable and
impalpable, invisible yet beholding all
things,&mdash;that sense which we call <em>intelligence</em>!</p>

<p>Alas! it is not that God has denied
this sense to these men of figures, of
science, and calculation; but they have
blinded themselves, they have cultivated
the other senses so much, that they
have weakened this. They have believed
too much in matter, and so they
have lost the eye of the spirit. These
men, we are told, have made great
progress in experimental science, but
they have made good, evil, to the
People, by saying to them, &ldquo;We,
who are so high, we cannot see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
God!&mdash;blind men! what do you see,
then?&rdquo;</p>

<h2>IX.</h2>


<p>Besides these men, there is still
another class,&mdash;inventors of another
science, which they call &ldquo;<em>Political
Economy</em>.&rdquo; This is the class of <em>Economists</em>.
I do not, indeed, speak of all
of them: there are among them some
who are as spiritual as Fenelon, and
these are, perhaps, at this day, the
greater number. I speak only of those
who, considering this world alone, have
been driven, voluntarily or involuntarily,
to Atheism in another way. Leaving
the eternal and fastidious metaphysical
and religions disputes in which the
theologians of past centuries wasted
the time, the good sense, and the blood
of men, to honor their pretended God
by immolating to Him the enemies of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
their faith, these <em>false economists</em> have
said to governments and people, &ldquo;Leave
all this; there is only one science which
is good for any thing: it is the science
of Wealth. All else is vanity and vexation
of spirit.&rdquo; This is the famous
cry, the cry of a materialistic society:&mdash;&ldquo;<em>Grow
rich!</em>&rdquo; The economists of
this school, now highly enlightened,
legitimate children of the materialists
of the Eighteenth Century, see in humanity,
only matter and the things that
belong to matter; in men, only consumers
and producers; in the social
functions, only labor of the hands:&mdash;to
labor, to sow, to reap, to hew, to
build, to forge, to weave, to barter, to
exchange, to sell, to buy, to acquire, to
beget,&mdash;this is, according to these disciples
of Malthus, the whole of man!
These are the Lycurguses and the
Moseses, the legislators of a trading
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
People: the moral, intellectual, spiritual,
religious man does not exist for
them. They love liberty, not because
it ennobles human nature; exercises
free will, the most sublime of man&rsquo;s
vital functions; cultivates his highest
faculty,&mdash;conscience; purifies religion,
the fundamental idea of mankind, from
the superstitions that debase and dishonor
it; sanctifies human society, by
leading it to the knowledge and worship
of God;&mdash;they love it because it abolishes
Custom House duties! All legislation,
all civilization, all religion, is
reduced by them to a well-balanced
account! <em>To have</em> and <em>to owe</em>, these
are the only two words in their language!
What matter to them the
spirit, the soul, virtue, sentiment?&mdash;What
the moral and consoling beliefs,
the divine hopes, the supernatural certainties,
revealed or proved, or the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
immortal destiny, of man?&mdash;What the
present intellectual life, and the future
immaterial life of these harvests of human
generations, which God sows that
they may bear fruit in his name, may
adore his grandeur,&mdash;which Death cuts
down to bear them, ripe in faith and
virtue, up to Heaven? All this can
neither be bought nor sold; all this has
neither stated price nor net revenue;
all this is not current on the Exchange,&mdash;therefore
it is nothing!</p>

<p>Thus these men count for nothing
the forms of worship and the forms of
government. They are neither followers
of Brama, of Confucius, of Mahomet,
of Plato, or of Rousseau; neither
absolute monarchists, constitutional
royalists, nor republicans. They are of
the politics, and of the religion, in
which they can manufacture most, buy
and sell easiest, trade the best, multiply
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
fastest! Their civilization is traffic;
their God is the dollar! This sect,
useful in administering intelligently the
affairs of commerce, has been a shadow
over intellectual civilization; for it has
forgotten heavenly things, and, in forgetting
them, has contributed to make
the People also forget them.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>X.</h2>


<p>But that People which forgets God,
forgets itself. What right has it to be
a People, if it have not its origin and
hope in Him? How can the men of
any nation expect tyrants to remember
and respect its destiny, if they themselves
debase this destiny to that of a
machine with ten fingers, destined to
weave the greatest possible number of
yards of cloth in seventy years, to people
as many hundred acres as possible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
with creatures as much to be pitied
and as miserable as themselves, and to
serve, from generation to generation,
as human manure for the land, to fertilize
the soil of their birth, their life,
and their graves? How can the moral
spiritualism of a People long resist such
theories? Where can they find God in
this workshop of matter?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>XI.</h2>


<p>But even this is nothing. The
French Revolution came in 1789. It
came to put an end to a double philosophy,&mdash;the
spiritual philosophy of
Rousseau&rsquo;s school, founded in reason
and religion, the material philosophy of
the school of Helvetius, Diderot, and
their disciples, atheistic and cynical.
The thought of the first of these philosophies
was religious at bottom. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
consisted merely in freeing the luminous
idea of God from the shadows by
which ignorance, intolerance, the inquisition
of temporal dynasties and times
of barbarism had falsified it,&mdash;in freeing
this idea, debased as it was,&mdash;obscured,
and enchained to thrones,&mdash;so
as to restore reason to its liberty, to
inquiry, to the free conscience of every
worship and of every soul; to revive it
in the eyes of the People, by leading
them to the broad light of day, the evidence
of nature, the dignity and efficacy
of free worship.</p>

<p>But, for this, it was necessary to
dispossess the Middle Ages of their
temporal power, of their <i>mort-main</i>
possessions, of their civil jurisdictions,
of their exclusive privileges, of their
legal intolerance against all other divine
thoughts, and all other individual or
national faith, all other forms of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
adoration and worship than what were imposed
by the exclusive and established
religion. To rally the people to this
work, a work legitimate in itself, a work
which the abuses of a crafty priesthood
had made necessary, seven times, and
whose accomplishment they had seven
times partially and gradually undertaken,
since the time of Charlemagne,&mdash;the
philosophers of the second
school, the irreligious school, the atheistic
school, of Diderot and Helvetius,
drove the masses from stupidity even
to impiety, and the demagogues of &rsquo;93
forced them from impiety to Atheism,
and from Atheism to blood. Demagogues,
those poisoners of liberty, corrupt
every revolution in which they
mingle; they defile every thing that
they touch; they dishonor every truth
which they profess, by polluting or perverting
it. The age and philosophy,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
Heaven and earth, desire what we too
desire,&mdash;freedom of conscience, voluntary
worship,&mdash;liberty of the human
mind in matters of faith,&mdash;the fraternity
of altars, invoking, each in its own
language, that God whom the whole
earth is spelling out, and who reveals,
from age to age, still another letter of
His divine name.</p>

<p>Instead of this, Atheists and demagogues
united to persecute religion, to
revenge themselves for the old persecutions
of the priesthood. They profaned
the temples, violated conscience,
blasphemed the God of the faithful, parodied
the ceremonies, cast to the winds
the pious symbols of worship, and persecuted
the ministers of religion.</p>

<p>In the name of the Revolution,
and under the menace of terror, they
dragged the People to these Saturnalia.
They corrupted the eyes, the hands,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
the minds, the souls of the populace.
These violences to the altar were cast
back on the religious idea itself. The
People, seeing the temple fall, believed
that Heaven itself crumbled; and that,
following the profaned image of a vanishing
worship, God himself would vanish
from the world, with conscience,
the supernatural law, the unwritten
moral law, the soul and the immortality
of the human race!</p>

<p>When the ignorant People no longer
saw God between them and annihilation,
they plunged into the boundless
and bottomless abyss of Atheism, they
lost their divine sense, they became
brutal as the animal, who sees in the
earth only a pasture ground, instead of
the footstool of Jehovah.</p>

<p>But these irreligious abominations,
and these Saturnalia of Atheism, however
much injury they inflicted on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
religious spirit of the People, did not
effect so much, perhaps, as the reign
which followed this anarchy, the reign
of Bonaparte, the so-called restorer of
worship. And how?</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>XII.</h2>


<p>The Republic had passed its paroxysm
of fever, of demagoguical madness,
of persecution. The Directory had
finally concentrated and regulated the
republican power. This government
was composed of men, naturally moderate
and tolerant, or made so by the
experience and the lassitude of anarchy;
the moderate principles of the
Revolution of 1789, and of the constituted
Assembly, regained their level,
thanks to a natural reaction, limited by
good sense, as happens after every revolution
that overshoots its mark. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
priests officiated, without obstacle, in
the temples restored by the municipalities
to the faithful, religion was entirely
free, even favored by public respect,
and by that care for good morals which
all serious governments feel. Faith,
taking refuge in men&rsquo;s consciences,
was, moreover, more sincere and more
active, because it was neither constrained,
nor favored, nor altered, nor
profaned by the hand of government.</p>

<p>This was, perhaps, the moment when
there was the most religion in France,&mdash;for
this was the moment when, after
having had its martyrs, the religious
sentiment had a life in itself, and owed
nothing to the partial and interested
protection of the powers of the State.
For, the less the State imposes upon
you a God of its own fashion, or its
own choice, the more does your conscience
rise, and the more does it attach
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
itself to the God of your own reason,
or your own faith!</p>

<p>Bonaparte, whose genius was entirely
military, but who, in affairs of moral,
civil, and religious government, made
it a matter of policy to contradict and
extinguish all the truths of the Revolution,
hastened to change all this. He
wished to parody Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Charlemagne had been the philosopher
and revolutionary organizer of his
time; Charlemagne had bound together
the spiritual and temporal, crowning
the Pontiff that he might be crowned
by him in turn. Bonaparte desired a
State religion, an agreement in which
religion and the empire should mutually
engage and mutually check each
other; a Pope to subdue, to caress, to
drive away, to recall, to persecute, by
turns; a coronation by the hand of an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
enslaved Church; then a Church to
chastise, when it did not obey;&mdash;in
one word, all that shameful and scandalous
<em>simony</em> of ancient times, when
the temporal power played, in the sight
of the nations, with the idea and name
of God, in a manner as contemptuous
as it was odious.</p>

<p>The People, who saw clearly through
this intrigue of an indifferent sovereign,&mdash;an
Atheist at Toulon, a crafty politician
at Marengo, a Mussulman in
Egypt, a persecutor at Rome, an oppressor
at Savona, a schismatic at
Fontainbleau, a saint at Notre Dame
de Paris,&mdash;protector of religion and
profaner of consciences by turns,&mdash;felt
their belief shaken anew. They asked
themselves, &ldquo;What then is God for us,
poor souls, since God is such an instrument
of power for great men, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
such a police machine for governments?&rdquo;
Scorn threw them back
into Atheism. This was natural.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>XIII.</h2>


<p>This system was continued, with
more sincerity on the part of government,
under the dynasty of the Restoration.
But the interested favors of
the Court, for the higher clergy of a
particular worship, irritated the minds
of the populace against the priesthood.</p>

<p>The more it lavished power and human
dignities upon priestly superiors,
the more the mind of the People turned
from the religious sentiment. Each
favor of royal authority to the privileged
Church cast thousands of souls
into Atheism.</p>

<p>The Revolution of July suppressed
the religion of the State: it was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
progress towards the religion of conscience.
But it favored the religion of
the majority; it still leaned towards
the supremacy of numbers in matters
of faith. However, from the moment
the State religion was suppressed, the
religion of conscience gained ground in
men&rsquo;s hearts. From 1830 to this day,
every intelligent observer gladly acknowledges
an immense progress in
the religious sentiment in France.&mdash;Why?
Because the suppression of
the official religion of the State was a
progress in the liberty of conscience,
and all progress in liberty of conscience
is a progress of human thought
toward the idea of God. Go farther
still, and complete liberty will destroy
Atheism in the People!</p>

<p>But the evil done was immense.
The cynicism of Diderot, materialism,
scepticism, revolutionary impiety, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
false and hypocritical piety of the empire,
the concordat, the restoration of
an imperial religion, and of an official
and dynastic God by Napoleon, the
tendency of the two Bourbon reigns to
reconstruct a political church, everlastingly
endowed with a monopoly of
goods and of souls,&mdash;and, finally, the
industrialism of the reign of Louis Philippe,
turning every thought to trade,
to manual labor, to worldly wealth, and
making gold the true and only God of
the century;&mdash;all this has borne its
fruits.</p>

<p>Look at these fruits at the present
day, and say, if practical Atheism does
not devour the souls of this People.
But let us proceed.</p>

<h2>XIV.</h2>


<p>For eighteen years, new sects, or,
rather, posthumous sects, have disputed
for the soul of the People, under the
names of Fourierism, of Pantheism, of
Communism, of Industrialism, of Economism,
and, finally, of Terrorism. Look
at them, listen to them, read them,
analyze them, sift them, handle them;
and say, if, with the exception of a
vague deifying of every thing,&mdash;that
is to say, of nothing, by the Fourierites,&mdash;there
is a single one of these philosophical,
social, or political sects, which
is not founded on the most evident
practical Atheism; which has not matter
for a God; material enjoyments for
morality; exclusive satisfaction of the
senses for an end; purely sensual gratifications
for a paradise; this world for
the sole scene of existence; the body
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
for the only condition of being; the
prolonging of life a few more years for
its only hope; a sharpening of the
senses to material appetites for a perspective;
death for the end of all
things; after death, an assimilation with
the dust of the earth for a future;
annihilation for justice, for reward, and
for immortality!</p>

<p>No, there has not been since 1830,
there has not been since the Revolution,
there is not at this moment, one
of these schools of pretended apostles,
prophets of the future, and saviors of
the present, which is not Materialism in
action. It is the deadly seed of the
century of Helvetius, producing its
poisons in the dregs of another century.
It is man, deprived of his spiritual and
immortal sense, reduced to a solid
measure of organized matter, and seeking,
not virtue, that key to his future
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
destiny, in his soul; but, in his senses,
mere enjoyment, that end of the brute,
who only believes in what he can eat
and drink.</p>

<h2>XV.</h2>


<p>Analyze with me, if you are not
overwhelmed with humiliation, the five
or six Revelations of the latter days; and
ask yourselves, as I have often asked
myself, while listening to them, if these
revealers of pretended human felicity
do indeed address themselves to men,
or to herds of fatted cattle! And are
they astonished that the intellectual
world resists them? Do they complain
that the ignorant are their only disciples?
Are they indignant that the
ideas they attempt to spread, creep, like
fetid mists, along the abysses of society,
and excite, instead of enthusiasm, only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
the fanaticism of hunger and thirst?
I can well believe it! What People is
there who would become fanatics, only
for their own destruction; renounce their
moral nature, their divine souls, their
immortal destinies, only for a morsel
of more savory bread upon their table,
for a larger portion of earth under their
feet? No! no! enthusiasm soars aloft,
it does not fall to earth. Bear me up
to Heaven, if you wish to dazzle my
eyes; promise me immortality, if you
would offer to my soul a motive worthy
of its nature, an aim worthy of its
efforts, a price worthy of its virtue!
But what do your systems of atheistic
society show us in perspective? What
do they promise us in compensation for
our griefs? What do they give us in
exchange for our souls? You know,&mdash;we
will not speak of it.</p>

<p>But, indeed, if these sects survive the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
month which sees and which produces
them; and, if these questions which
they debate, and these systems which
they bring before the astonished People,
are destined to serve as enigmas to posterity;
what will the future say of us?
It will only explain the Materialism,
Atheism, and brutality of the doctrines
and sects by which we have been
disturbed for ten or twelve years, as the
nightmare of a starving People, whose
dreams have, for an object, only a frantic
satisfaction of the senses. All these
philosophies, or all these deliriums, are
the deliriums or philosophies of the
stomach! &ldquo;All this epoch,&rdquo; future historians
will say, &ldquo;the French must have
been a nation distressed by a terrible
famine, to have forgotten, in so total an
eclipse of the intellectual nature, the
great and immortal ideas which have
alone inspired even these, the human
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
race, and rendered the revolutions of
the People worthy of the regard of posterity,
and of the blood of man. The
Eighteenth Century must have been a
time when avaricious Nature shut up
her bosom, and the earth brought forth
neither fruit nor harvests, that this
great intellectual People, formerly
called the French People, should have
forgotten their souls for a morsel of
bread, their immortality for an income,
and their God for a dollar! Let
us turn away our eyes and weep over
that age.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>XVI.</h2>


<p>See where we were when the Republic
arose: happy was it that the People
had at bottom more of the true sentiment
of God than these masters and
heads of sects. For, what would have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
become of us, if, in that total eclipse
of government, of armed force, and of
law, which followed the 24th of February,
the People, masters of all, of the
fortunes and lives of the citizens, of
Heaven and earth, had been a People
of Materialists, of Terrorists, and of
Atheists? The Revolution would have
been a pillage, the Republic a scaffold,
the dynasty of the People a deluge of
blood. But there was no such thing.
God was there. He revealed Himself
in the multitude; Materialism disappeared
in enthusiasm, which always
exhibits the divinity of the human heart.</p>

<p>We heard but one cry,&mdash;&ldquo;Honor to
God! Respect for the altars! Liberty
to their ministers! Self-denial, harmony,
protection to the weak, inviolability
of property, assistance to the miserable!&rdquo;
Yes,&mdash;on the first day, and
during the whole time that the People
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
was alone and burning with excitement,
it was religious! It was not until after
the cooling of this enthusiasm that the
materialistic sects, who waited their
opportunity afar off, and who now torment
the People, dared to offer their
sensual symbols, and to set up Capital
and Interest, the organization of labor,
the increase of wages, and equality of
conditions in this human manger, as the
sole Divinities,&mdash;dared to infuse envy
against the happy, the breath of hatred
as the only consolation to the hearts
of the miserable, lightning vengeance
against the wrongs of Providence, imprecations
against society, blasphemies
against the existence of God, the enjoyments
and bestialities of the corporeal
nature, purchased by complete forgetfulness
of the moral nature, and enjoyed
in a debauch of ideas, and in a deification
of matter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
This cannot last; the People will not
allow themselves to be changed into
hogs by the Circes of Atheism. Their
souls will flash indignation against their
transformers. A day will come when
they will see that they are impoverished
under the pretext of being enriched;
that, when they are robbed of their
souls and of God, both their titles to
liberty are stolen from them. Atheism
and Republicanism are two words which
exclude each other. Absolutism may
thrive without a God, for it needs only
slaves. Republicanism cannot exist
without a God, for it must have citizens.
And what is it that makes
citizens? Two things,&mdash;the sentiment
of their rights, and the sentiment
of their duties as a republican People.
Where are your rights, if you have
not a common Father in Heaven?
Where are your duties, if you have not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
a Judge between your brothers and
you? Republicanism draws you in
both these ways to God.</p>

<h2>XVII.</h2>


<p>Thus, look at every free People, from
the mountains of Helvetia to the forests
of America; see even the free British
nation, where the Aristocracy is only
the head of liberty, where the Aristocracy
and Democracy mutually respect
each other, and balance each other by
an exchange of kindnesses and services
which sanctify society while fortifying
it. Atheism has fled before liberty: in
proportion as despotism has receded,
the divine idea has advanced in the
souls of men. Liberty lives by morality.
What is morality without a God?
What is a law without a lawgiver?</p>

<p>I know well, and I shall give you the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
reason hereafter; I know well, and I
mourn to think of it, that, even up to
the present time, the French People
have been the least religious People in
Europe.</p>

<p>Is this because the intelligence of
France has not that force, and that
severity, which are needed to carry long
enough and far enough the idea of
God,&mdash;the greatest idea of the human
soul;&mdash;that idea, as it comes from all
the evidences of nature, and all the
depths of reflection, being the most
powerful and the most grave of human
intelligence,&mdash;and the intelligence of
France being the most superficial, the
most light, and the least reflecting of
the European races?</p>

<p>Is it because our governments have
always been charged with thinking,
believing, and praying, for us?</p>

<p>Is it that they have always given us

gods of the Court, worship according to
Etiquette, and religions of State, instead
of letting us form, make, and practise
our faith for ourselves, by reason, by
free-will, by voluntary piety, by association,
by tradition, by the sympathies of
the community, of worship, and of the
family?</p>

<p>Is it because we are, and always have
been, a military People, a nation of
soldiers and adventurers, led by kings,
heroes, ambitious men, from battle-field
to battle-field, making conquests
and not keeping them, ravaging, dazzling,
charming, and corrupting Europe,
and bearing the manners, vices, bravado,
lightness, and impiety of the camp into
the homes of the People?</p>

<p>I do not know; but it is certain that
the nation has an immense progress to
make in serious thought, if it wishes to
maintain its liberty. If we look at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
comparative character, in matters of
religious sentiment, of the great nations
of Europe, America, and even Asia, the
advantage is not on our side. While
the great men of other nations live and
die upon the scene of history, looking
towards heaven, our great men seem
to live and die in entire forgetfulness
of the only idea for which life or death
is worth any thing; they live and die
looking at the spectators, or, at most,
towards posterity.</p>

<p>Thus, even at the present time, while
we have had the greatest men, other
nations have had the greatest citizens.
It is great citizens that a Republic
needs!</p>

<h2>XVIII.</h2>


<p>Open the history of America, the
history of England, and the history of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
France; read the great lives, the great
deaths, the great sufferings, the sublime
words, when the ruling passion of life
reveals itself in the last moments of
the dying,&mdash;and compare them!</p>

<p>Washington and Franklin fought,
spoke, suffered; rose and fell, in their
political life, from popularity to ingratitude,
from glory to bitter scorn of their
citizens,&mdash;always in the name of God,
for whom they acted; and the liberator
of America died, committing to the
Divine protection, first, the liberty of
his People,&mdash;and, afterwards, his own
soul to His indulgent judgment.</p>

<p>Strafford, dying for the constitution
of his country, wrote to Charles I., to
entreat his consent to his punishment,
that he might spare trouble to the
State: &ldquo;Put not your trust,&rdquo; wrote he,
after this consent was obtained, &ldquo;put
not your trust in princes, or in the son
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
of man, because salvation is not in
them, but from on high.&rdquo; While walking
to the scaffold, he stopped under
the windows of his friend, the Bishop
of London; he raised his head towards
him, and asked, in a loud voice, the
assistance of his prayers in the terrible
moment to which he had come. The
primate, bowed with age, and bathed in
tears, gave, in a stifled voice, his tender
benedictions to his unhappy friend, and
fell, without consciousness, into the
arms of his attendants. Strafford continued
his way, sustained by the Divine
force, descending from this invocation
upon him: he spoke with resignation
to the People assembled to see him die.
&ldquo;I fear only one thing,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and
that is, that this effusion of innocent
blood is a bad presage for the liberty
of my country!&rdquo; (Alas! why did not
the Convention recall these words
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
among us, in &rsquo;93?) Stafford continued:&mdash;&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;I draw near
my end. One blow will make my
wife a widow, my children orphans,
deprive my poor servants of an affectionate
master, and separate me from
my dear brother, and my friends.
May God be all of these!&rdquo; He disrobed
himself, and placed his head on
the block. &ldquo;I give thanks,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to my heavenly Master for helping me
to await this blow without fear; for not
permitting me to be cast down for a
single instant by terror. I repose my
head as willingly on this block as I ever
laid it down to sleep.&rdquo; This is faith in
Patriotism! See Charles I., in his
turn,&mdash;that model of a kingly death.
At the moment that he was to receive
the blow of the axe, the edge of which
he had coolly examined and touched,
he raised his head, and addressed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
clergyman who was present:&mdash;&ldquo;Remember!&rdquo;
said he; as if he had said,
&ldquo;Remember to advise my sons never to
revenge their father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sidney, the young martyr of a patriotism,
guilty, because too hasty, died to
expiate the dream of the freedom of
his country. He said to the jailer,
&ldquo;May my blood purify my soul! I
rejoice that I die innocent toward the
king, but a victim resigned to the King
of Heaven, to whom we owe all life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The republicans of Cromwell sought
only the way of God, even in the blood
of battles. Their politics is nothing
but faith; their government, a prayer;
their death, a holy hymn;&mdash;they sang,
like the Templars, on their funeral-pile.
We see, we feel, we hear God, above
all, in these revolutions, in these great
popular movements, and in the souls
of the great citizens of these nations.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
But recross the Atlantic, traverse the
Channel, approach our own time, open
our annals; and listen to the great
political actors in the drama of our
liberty. It would seem as if God was
hidden from the souls of men; as if his
name had never been written in the
language. History will have the air
of being atheistic, while recounting to
posterity these <em>annihilations</em>, rather than
<em>deaths</em>, of the celebrated men of the
greatest years of France. The victims
alone have a God; the tribunes and
lictors have none.</p>

<p>See Mirabeau on his death-bed.
&ldquo;Crown me with flowers,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;intoxicate me with perfumes, let me
die with the sound of delicious music.&rdquo;
Not one word of God, or of his soul!
A sensual philosopher, he asks of death
only a supreme sensualism; he desires
to give a last pleasure even to agony.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
Look at Madam Roland, that strong
woman of the Revolution,&mdash;upon the
car that carries her to death. She
looks with scorn upon the stupid People,
who kill their prophets and their sibyls.
Not one glance to Heaven; only an
exclamation for the earth she leaves:&mdash;&ldquo;O,
Liberty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Approach the prison door of the
Girondines: their last night is a banquet,
and their last hymn is the <i>Marseillaise</i>!</p>

<p>Follow Camille Desmoulins to punishment:&mdash;a
cold and indecent pleasantry
at the tribunal; one long imprecation
on the road to the guillotine;&mdash;those
are the last thoughts of this
dying man, about to appear on high!</p>

<p>Listen to Danton, upon the platform
of the scaffold, one step from God and
immortality:&mdash;&ldquo;I have enjoyed much;
let me go to sleep,&rdquo; he says;&mdash;then, to
the executioner, &ldquo;You will show my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
head to the People; it is worth while!&rdquo;
Annihilation for a confession of faith;
vanity for his last sigh: such is the
Frenchman of these latter days!</p>

<p>What do you think of the religious
sentiment of a free People, whose great
characters seem to walk thus in procession
to annihilation; and die, without
even death, that terrible minister, recalling
to their minds the fear or the
promises of God?</p>

<p>Thus the Republic,&mdash;which had no
future,&mdash;reared by these men, and
mere parties, was quickly overthrown
in blood. Liberty, achieved by so
much heroism and genius, did not find
in France a conscience to shelter it, a
God to avenge it, a People to defend it,
against that other Atheism called Glory!
All was finished by a soldier, and by the
apostacy of republicans travestied into
courtiers! And what could you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
expect? Republican Atheism has no
reason to be heroic. If it is terrified,
it yields. Would one buy it, it sells
itself; it would be most foolish to
sacrifice itself. Who would mourn for
it?&mdash;the People are ungrateful, and
God does not exist.</p>

<p>Thus end atheistic revolutions!</p>

<p>If you wish that this revolution
should not have the same end, beware
of abject Materialism, degrading Sensualism,
gross Socialism, of besotted
Communism; of all these doctrines of
flesh and blood, of meat and drink, of
hunger and thirst, of wages and traffic,
which these corruptors of the soul of
the People preach to you, exclusively,
as the sole thought, the sole hope, as
the only duty, and only end of man!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
They will soon make you slaves of ease,
serfs of your desires.</p>

<p>Are you willing to have inscribed on
the tomb of our French race, as on that
of the <em>Sybarites</em>, this epitaph: &ldquo;This
People ate and drank well, while they
browsed upon the earth?&rdquo; No! You
desire that History should write thus:
&ldquo;This People worshipped well, served
God and humanity well,&mdash;in thought, in
philosophy, in religion, in literature, in
arts, in arms, in labor, in liberty, in
their Aristocracies, in their Democracies,
in their Monarchies, and their Republics!
This nation was the spiritual
laborer, the conqueror of truth; the
disciple of the highest God, in all the
ways of civilization,&mdash;and, to approach
nearer to him, it invented the Republic,
that government of duties and of rights,
that rule of spiritualism, which finds in
<em>ideas</em> its only sovereignty.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
Seek God, then. This is your nature
and your grandeur. And do not seek
Him in these Materialisms! For God
is not below,&mdash;he is on high!</p>
